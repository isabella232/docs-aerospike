This documentation describes the Aerospike Service Broker for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). The Aerospike Service Broker registers a service broker on PCF and exposes its service plans on the Marketplace. Developers can create instances of these service plans using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI), and bind them to applications to access an existing Aerospike database.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Aerospike is a high-performance, distributed, scalable NoSQL database and key/value store. 

The Aerospike Service Broker for PCF integrates your Aerospike database with your PCF deployment, by automatically discovering the [namespaces](http://www.aerospike.com/docs/architecture/data-model.html#namespaces) that have been created on the database and exposing them as service plans in the Marketplace. Developers can create instances of these service plans and bind them to applications to provide connection information to the applications.

The Aerospike Service Broker for PCF has the following features:

* Key-value store
* Flexible data model
* User-defined functions
* Geospatial support
* Aggregations
* Geographic replication
* Open-source

## <a id="reqs"></a>Requirements

Aerospike Service Broker for PCF has the following requirements:

* You must have an Aerospike database server deployed. 
* Your Aerospike database must have a namespace configured to store service and application binding information for the Aerospike Service Broker. 
* If you have deployed the Enterprise Edition of the Aerospike database server, you must also configure a user with read-write permissions to the designated namespace. This user must also have user-admin permissions because the Aerospike Service Broker will create and delete users during the application binding and unbinding operations.

For more information about how to deploy an Aerospike database, see the [Aerospike documentation](https://www.aerospike.com/docs/operations).
